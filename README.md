# MyCodeBlog

This blog is a web application that allows the visualization and creation of posts for the people interested in programming topics. It has been created though a SSR approach in Java with Spring Boot.

The app's deploy will occur at the Elastic Beanstalk due to its easy and fast configuration, and the relational database Postgres will be deployed at Amazon RDS. 

Regarding the goal of this project, it has been built to experience an end to end process of building and deploying a web application inside the Spring Boot environment and as a consequence obtain an improvement at my knowledge about the pros and cons of these technologies.
