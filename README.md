# MyCodeBlog

This blog has been created by using SSR in Java and JPA Repository to establish communication with the database.
The web application allows the visualization and creation of posts for the people interested in programming topics.

The deploy of the app will occur at the Elastic Beanstalk due to its easy and fast configuration, and Amazon RDS will 
be used to deploy the Postgres relational database.

And the goal of this project is to have an end to end experience of building and deploying a web application inside the Spring Boot environment in order to improve my knowledge about the pros and cons of these technologies.
